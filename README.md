# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

This project was completed for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to alter existing code to use Apollo and GraphQL, replacing the existing RESTful API. The application is a book search engine that allows users to sign up, search books, and save books to their profiles.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This project is being deployed on Render at the following URL: [https://boamarant.github.io/Personal-Blog-App/](https://boamarant.github.io/Personal-Blog-App/). 

## Credits

I referenced previous projects and examples from the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp to assist in creating this page. 

## Features

Currently, this application is not functional. I wasn't able to resolve issues with the actual functionality of the page. I tried many solutions and none of them seemed to work. Currently, the page only allows users to view the home page and click on the login/sign up button, but logging in, signing up, and searching for books are not actually working at this time.

## Known Issues

The book search functionality is not working correctly; the search bar takes the user off of the text box after each letter typed, and the search button does not yield results. Additionally, the signing up and logging in functionality is not working properly.
